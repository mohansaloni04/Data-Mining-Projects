# Data-Mining-Projects
This repository contains the class project which I did as a part of my Master's in Science in Software Engineering.

Following are the instructions to run the project

1) The dataset could not be directly uploaded as the filesize is huge.Hence , download the dataset from link the http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ .In the Files section , click the link '5-core' in the health and Personal care products.
2) Once the dataset is downloaded, install Anaconda for Python 2.7 and for Windows Opertaing System/Mac OS.Link - https://www.anaconda.com/download/.
3) Once the installation is done, open Jupyter Notebook and upload the two Python files 'aggregated_reviews.ipynb' and 'individual_reviews.ipynb' and the dataset in the Jupyter Notebook.
4) Execute the two python files.One is where every review is considered individually and for other, the review is aggregated on the basis of product ID and rating.

The above instructions were to run the project without UI.

To run the project with UI, follow the instruction ReadMe.txt
